# ao3 saver

This is the repository for the browser extension ao3 saver. This repo only contains the code for the front end. This extension also depends on a backend for its basic functions to work. The code for the backend service can be found here: https://github.com/Themis3000/ao3_saver_backend

This extension helps preserve works on ao3. When the extension is installed & enabled viewed works will be automatically backed up to the backend service. If the work is ever removed, and you are met with a 404 page ao3 saver will provide a link to the backed up copy stored on the server. Using this extension, you should never lose a work after its deletion.

### Features

- Automatic work backup
- Queryable viewed work history, sorted by last viewed
- Additional buttons to assist with finding works not previously backed up on ao3 saver servers
